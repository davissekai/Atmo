## I want to state out how the tool was built

The tool is composed of 3 parts. 
1. The prompts.py which contains the prompts to the LLM
2. The main.py module which serves as the control and logic centre
3. The llm.py module which contains the LLM call. 

The first part built was the prompts module, where the prompt chaining was defined. 
Second part was the llm module, where the LLM call was defined. 
Third part was the main module, where the control and logic centre was defined. 

There's a lot of nitty gritties.. but I'll get to em eventually.. I'll understand everything holistically soon enough.
